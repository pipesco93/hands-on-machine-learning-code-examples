# Hands-On Machine Learning Code Examples

This repository contains code examples and experiments based on the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to follow along with the book, implement key concepts, and experiment with different techniques using **Google Colab notebooks**.

## Notes

- This repository is for learning and experimentation.
- Code is adapted from the book with modifications for better understanding.
- Some notebooks may include additional explanations, tests, and variations.
