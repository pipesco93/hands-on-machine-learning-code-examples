# Hands-On Machine Learning Code Examples

This repository contains code examples and experiments based on the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to follow along with the book, implement key concepts, and experiment with different techniques using **Google Colab notebooks**.

## Notes

- This repository is for learning and experimentation.
- Code is adapted from the book with modifications for better understanding.
- Some notebooks may include additional explanations, tests, and variations.
- All notebooks in this repository are **open-source** and part of the interactive learning resources inspired by Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.
- My only intention is to practice and reinforce the concepts covered in the book.
- The original repository by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron can be found here: [Handson-ML2](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3).
