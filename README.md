# Hands-On Machine Learning Code Examples

This repository contains code examples and experiments based on the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to follow along with the book, implement key concepts, and experiment with different techniques using **Google Colab notebooks**.

## Contents

- **Supervised Learning**: Examples covering regression and classification tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Time Series & Reinforcement Learning**: Additional experiments with forecasting and RL techniques.

## Notes

- This repository is for learning and experimentation.
- Code is adapted from the book with modifications for better understanding.
- Some notebooks may include additional explanations, tests, and variations.
